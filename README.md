## About Me:

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a Full-Stack Developer, currently working at iPay Sri Lanka specializing in Fintech technology.

ðŸ’» My main focus is on backend development using Spring Boot and Spring Boot MVC for scalable and efficient applications. I also have experience working on frontend projects with React, and I'm passionate about bridging the gap between backend and frontend technologies.

ðŸŽ“ I'm pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Westminster, and continuously learning new tools to build seamless, full-stack solutions.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m always exploring the latest in Java, JavaScript, and modern web development frameworks to sharpen my skills and push my boundaries.

Let's connect and build something amazing together! ðŸ˜Š
